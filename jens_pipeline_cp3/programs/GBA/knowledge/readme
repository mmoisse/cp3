lcrs
is used to get a complexity cutoff during the entension of the
longest-path intervals. It is used by the fixed sampling (i.e., 27 LCRs
from five sequences masked by SEG.

comCut27Seg
contains the average complexity of all lcrs in the above file ("lcrs").

comCutOffValue*
are complexity cutoff values for the entension of the longest-path
intervals. They are generated using conditional-sampling, i.e., 
G_t / sqrt(t) <= C*u_t by applications/ComplexityCutoffGenerator.java. 


blosum62Matrix
is used when computing complexities.

chosen* and samp*
are used for the step: comparing consecutive intervals.

plot
is used to generate sample*
