From the results reported in the paper the chosen models for:

(1)
X-ray fast  = aspritz

xray569: Here we choose aspritz for efficiency reasons. The argument for this is that Sw is
not significantly different from combo or sspritz and the inputs to aspritz is only 5 (compared to sspritz 20). 
In addition, aspritz has a slightly better AUC than sspritz. 

casp9: aspritz is state-of-the-art compared to all other fast predictors. 

Note: for execution of 1% of the human genome aspritz takes 3mins, while combo takes aprrox 7mins



(2)

NMR fast = sspritz

SSpritz is not signicantly different from combo (t-test). Since, combo is twice as slow as 
SSpritz we choose SSpritz for efficiency reasons. 



(3)

Disprot = combo (i.e. sspritz + aspritz)

combo has significantly better AUC but and the best Sw. However, sw is not signifcantly better compared to other fast 
methods.

#

(1)
X-ray = combo_all (i.e. sspritz + aspritz + sspritzp + aspritzp)

Although SSpritzP has a better Sw on 560 x-ray defined proteins it seems that combo_all has the best AUC. In addition, Sw and 
AUC are best on the CASP9 data. 


(2) 
NMR = combo_all (i.e. sspritz + aspritz + sspritzp + aspritzp)

Although combo_psi has the best Sw but it is not significantly better than combo_all. In addition, 
combo_all has a signicantly better AUC.
