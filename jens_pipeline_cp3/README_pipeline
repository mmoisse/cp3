This pipeline is designed to take single fasta sequences in a certain format and input them into the predictors for intrinsic disorder.

The overall flowchart of the pipeline looks something like this:

1. 
Prior to initiating the pipeline, sequences need to be formatted correctly. The correct format is seen below, WITHOUT STOP CODONS.

	>YAL017W PSK1
	SEQUENCEHERE...

The first name (usually systematic name, but it could be reversed) will be used for the naming of the result files.
The sequence files need to ONLY CONTAIN ONE sequence each.

2. 
The folder called pre-processing helps to modify syntax of files prior to initiation of the pipeline. 

	2.1 If your sequences are found in a single file, run the script called "fasta_list_split.sh" using the command:

	    ./fasta_list_split.sh X 
	    where: 
	    X is the name of the sequence file
	
	    The folder fasta_split_results will contain the sequence results.

	2.2 With your single fasta sequence files ready, run "syntax_modifying_script.sh" using the command:

	   ./syntax_modifying_script.sh X Y
	   where:
	   X is the name of the folder containing only the sequence files
	   Y is the field of the identifier line used for naming of subsequent files. (In the earlier example given of format, a flag
	   of 1 would name the files according to the systematic name while 2 would name them according to the common name.)

	   Running this command will remove stop codons and rename all files according to their systematic or common name.

3. 
With the sequence files modified to the correct syntax, move them to the working directory of the start_script.sh.

Initiate the analysis using the command:

./start_script.sh X Y
where:
X is the name of the folder containing the sequences.
Y is the desired name for the output folder.

4.
The analysis should complete within 20 minutes for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome.
Result files are stored in the result_folder folder
